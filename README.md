# Idea
The comments in the code are in Brazilian Portuguese, feel free to translate them.

I created this code with the intent of automating a repetitive command for ChatGPT to generate 50 sentences. My goal is to create 500,000 sentences, so I developed the code to automate the command submission. I included a random time delay so that the commands are sent at random intervals, avoiding detection as a bot.

# Updates
You're welcome to help improve the code; I will make enhancements available.

Enjoy :-)
